# The Daily Journal

The daily journal is a platform that we created based on a project of our school called “Elevateen”. Elevateen was pointed towards empowering teenagers of our school to be more creative and innovative. The Elevateen project is now closed due to a lack of resources and manpower to run it. Now I try to raise it up again with a new name called [The Daily Journal](https://medium.com/the-daily-journal).

The Daily Journal is here to inspire you through our experiences and life journeys. We will cover a lot of things from daily life, lifestyle and many more. Every day we will post something that easy to read and understand.

The reason why I’m building this publication is that I always wanted to make my own platform to share my thoughts and to accompany writers that are in the same niche as we do. But I’ve stumbled upon many tech difficulties that I finally fell in love with this wonderful platform called Medium.

We also want to create a platform for you, writers to express your writing through this media. The sky is the limit here. And the possibilities are endless.
