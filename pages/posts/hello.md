# The Beginning

Welcome to my first ever online journal and blog kinda things here. In this site, you'll be able to read things that I have in mind. Firstly, let me introduce my self. My name is Rizqy Syandana Putra, you can call me Dan for shorts. I'm a creative designer and a front-end developer.

Currently studying at a college in Jakarta, majoring in Graphic Design. Now in my second semester. Still a long ways to go. But I do enjoy the process so much.

What I mean of Creative Designer is this. I like to create things. I don't know why, but if I don't do anything during a day, I can feel really bored. So, I'm trying something new or interesting every single day to fill my curiosity glass that needs to be filled.

I'm not also doing Graphic Design, I do also make [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLaOO37RenBsDLBRyJjWN3g) videos. I've been having this passion to teach other people something. Maybe someday I can be a teacher or a mentor ðŸ˜‚. Talking about teaching, I'm also have created my first ever course on the topic of "Introduction to Adobe Illustrator". And you can guess it, gosh I enjoyed teaching so much! I would love to teach something in the future.

## About this website

Maybe let's talk about this site for a bit!

The reason that I made this shiny new website is to host all my writing madness. Basicly this is a blog site. Previously, I have made a [portfolio](https://syandsign.now.sh) website. But the site was a total nightmare XD. So many bugs that I couldn't handle by my self. If you open the site, you will see a "maintenance" page that I've never maintain lol.

As a result, I'm now stepping down a bit. Simplify some areas and here it is. My tiny and simple website that I could handle and maintain. Hopefully in the future I can continue on my main website. But for now, here it is. My beautiful piece of mind.

## Closing

Thank you for reading this post! I hope this post can inspire you the viewers.
