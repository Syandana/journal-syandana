# 7 Reasons Why You Always Lose Motivation on Your Projects

**Syandana** (5/5/2021) — Have you ever lose motivation when working on a project or something? I've been encountered these problem for many times. And here is how I made it through.

## Too big projects

The most common mistake that you make is choosing their project too big. Yes, including my self. They only have that big vision of making the next Instagram and want to start right away with it. It’s good if you have a really big dream but, if you do this, you will quickly lose motivation because the amount of work overwhelms you. I think its better to start small then go big after time.

If you followed me on my [instagram](https://instagram.com/syandanax), you might have seen my story highlights about "Hustle vs Burnout". Right there I've been overwhelmed by the work that I put for building my portfolio website and doing side projects. After that moments, I try to manage my expectation and starting small. Like someone says "Dream Big, Start Small". And here we are today, with my small, and yet simple website that I can handle and manage.

## Relying on too many stuff you don’t know

If your projects require knowing retrofit, Coroutines, Work manager, and Dagger and you don’t know any of this yet, it might be better to choose a project in which you only use Retrofit and learn it.

## Not setting goals

If you don’t know what you do this for, you can lose motivation faster than you think. A **goal** could be for example to be able to make an app or content which you earn some money or to work as a freelancer someday. It motivates you to think about these things you really want. It's important to make a smart goal that I've talked about in this story.

## Comparing your self to the others

There is always be people that better designers, programmers, artist than you. People tend to only compare to people who are better at something which can be really depressing. The only person you should compare yourself to is the person you were yesterday.

## Not doing activities that require discipline

Discipline is like a muscle. The more often you do something that requires disciple the stronger it gets and the easier it is for you to be disciplined. Many people don't train this muscle, even though it has an effect on their entire life. So make sure to do small disciplines each day like taking a cold shower or going for a run.

Talking about discipline, let's say you have a college tasks or a commisioned work and the deadline of that task is next week. Some of us maybe chopping that task into small bite size that they do everyday. And the rest maybe doing it at later times like 2 or even 1 day before the deadline. This is not good for your health and sanity. Working overnight may overcome to some health issues one day. So make sure you have your task layed out.

## Wanting it too fast

We’re used to getting everything immediately. Contacting our friends, getting food or ordering online shop, everything is getting faster and faster. But working takes time. If you realize after a 24-hour work marathon that your tasks are still not finished, you might be frustrated and quit. Therefore, always value consistency over speed.

## Doing your own thing

Talking to other people can really helo you to stay motivated for your own projects. So try to find friends who do the same as you and don't just lock yourself in your room to code non-stop. Try to socialize with others.

That’s it for this story. And as always, thanks for reading.
