**Kopiqy** â€” Today the multimedia students of SMKN 1 Bekasi are being prepared to face the Competency Test or the so-called "ukom". This measurement is used to measure the level of competency of a junior high school student whether he is competent in his area of expertise or not.

For 2020, we are 21st grade multimedia students class 21 being prepared to face the UKOM which will be held around February.

For this pre-ukom preparation we are asked to make a branding from food / beverage products that have been determined by our teacher. We are welcome to choose one of the types that have been determined. Among others are:

- Snacks (Banana nuggets, takoyaki)

- Heavy food (geprek chicken, burger)

- Beverage (boba, thai tea or coffee

After selecting one food / drink that is of interest, students are distributed one sheet of A4 hvs paper to begin sketching the logo. The logo starts from logotype, logogram, and mix.

We were given about 5 hours to make the branding. I chose to make coffee branding because I can make it. The coffee brand that I made is called "kopiqy".

As the name implies, "kopiqy" means coffee made by Rizqy. Hehe, according to my name. But it's also pretty good for long-term business ideas later. I'm just here, just make a logotype that contains the identity of the coffee drink.

The font selection is also good and easy to read and remember. Application in other forms of design is also quite easy and easy to see.

Then, after finishing branding in paper form. We are scheduled to practice for the next 2 weeks to make it in digital form. In this digital format, we are also asked to make posters and advertising media.
